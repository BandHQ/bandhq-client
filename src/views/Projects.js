      <p>
        Here you'll be able to create your projects (Bands), add which members
        you're looking for and tag the project with genres and similar artists
        so other musicians can easily find your project.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other users will then be able to message you through BandHQ so you can
        get creative and talk ideas. Once you've made a decision you'll be able
        to add that user to the project so you can start collaborating on
        tracks.
